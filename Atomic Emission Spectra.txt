Atomic Emission Spectra
The set of frequencies of the electromagnetic waves emitted by atoms of the element.
Each element has a very specific range of colors that are emitted
These are used to identify elements and elements within compounds.
The farther the electron moves, the shorter the wavelength which means a higher FREQUENCY
ðŸ§‘ Niels Bohr (1913)
Studied the hydrogen atom and determined that the atom only had a certain allowable energy states.
Lowest possible energy state is called Ground State
When the atoms absorb energy it is said to be in an Excited State
Bohr Suggested that the electrons around the hydrogen atom could only be allowed in certain circular orbits around the nucleus.
The smaller the electronsâ€™s orbit, the lower atomâ€™s energy state or energy level.
The larger the electronâ€™s orbit, the higher the atomâ€™s
ðŸ§‘ Erwin Schrodinger (1926)
Austrian Physicist
Quantum Mechanical model of the atom: the atomic model in which electrons are treated as waves
This allowed for scientists to determine particular volumes of space around the nucleus in which the probability of finding an electron is very high
 
Atomic Orbital: The probable location of an electron within an atom.
Quantum Mechanical Model
Principal Quantum number: number of the atomic orbitals
As 
These energy levels contain what are called energy sub levels
Rules for Electron Configuration
There are three rules that must be followed while writing electron configurations
Rule 1: Aufbau Principle
Rule 2: Pauli Exclusion Principle
Rule 3: Hundâ€™s rule
